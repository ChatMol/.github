### The AI Infrastructure Layer for Molecular Discovery

ChatMol is building the **AI-native operating system for biological sciences and engineering**.

We transform natural language into executable molecular workflows — enabling scientists, simulation engineers, and biotech teams to move from hypothesis to simulation to insight dramatically faster.

## 🚨 The Problem

Computational molecular science is:

* Complex and tool-fragmented
* Dependent on legacy interfaces
* Difficult to scale across teams
* Bottlenecked by domain expertise

Despite billions spent annually on molecular R&D, simulation tools remain command-line driven, configuration-heavy, and inaccessible to non-experts.

AI copilots transformed software development.
Scientific computing is next.

## 💡 The Solution

ChatMol introduces a new abstraction layer:

> Natural Language → Structured Scientific Reasoning → Executable Simulation Workflows

We build:

* **[ChatMol Copilot](https://github.com/ChatMol/ChatMol/tree/main/copilot_public)** — The first computational biology agent, published in ACL 2024
* **[GROMACS Copilot](https://github.com/ChatMol/gromacs_copilot)** — AI copilot for molecular dynamics
* **[molecule-mcp](https://github.com/ChatMol/molecule-mcp)** — Infrastructure connecting AI agents to simulation engines
* **[ChatMol Lab](https://lab.cloudmol.org/)** — Cloud-based AI-assisted molecular modeling platform

Together, these form the foundation for **AI-augmented and eventually autonomous molecular research environments**.

## 🔭 Vision

Long term, we enable:

* Autonomous AI agents designing molecular systems
* AI-driven simulation loops with optimization feedback
* Conversational scientific computing environments
* Fully AI-augmented research labs

ChatMol aims to become the foundational layer for next-generation molecular discovery.
